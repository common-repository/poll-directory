This plugin allows you to display a random pre-made poll. Choose a topic - we do the rest.  A great sidebar widget to add fresh content.

== Description ==

The Poll Directory is filled with hundreds of pre-made user polls.  Each are assigned to specific popular topics and categories.  Choose a topic from the list and then the Poll Directory does the rest.  It's a great sidebar addition to provide fresh content for website or blog.

The plugin includes a sidebar widget so that you can place the polling app easily into your sidebar and wordpress theme.

After users submit an answer a response graph will show allowing users to see how the public has responded.

All polls and data is maintained by Dimbal Software via the Holy Poll website at http://www.holypoll.com - you don't have to worry about a thing.  Just choose your category and the plugin does the rest.
